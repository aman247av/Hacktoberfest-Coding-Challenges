## Hacktoberfest Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest repository! 🎉 We're excited to have you participate and contribute to open-source projects. Please follow the guidelines outlined below to ensure a smooth and rewarding experience for everyone.

## 📜 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Contribute New Problems Only**:  
   You can make a pull request only for a **new problem statement**. Solutions to already existing problems will be marked as **invalid** and **rejected**.
   
2. **Problem Source**:  
   Problems can be taken from any reputable coding platform like **CodeChef**, **CodeForces**, **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, etc. Please ensure you mention the source in your problem file.

3. **File Naming Convention**:  
   - The file name should be the **exact name of the question**.
   - If the question name contains spaces, replace the spaces with **underscores (`_`)**.
   - Add the appropriate file extension based on the language used:
     - For example, if the question is "Score More Buddy", rename it as `Score_More_Buddy.cpp`, `Score_More_Buddy.java`, `Score_More_Buddy.py`, or `Score_More_Buddy.c` based on the language of your choice.

4. **Adding the Problem Link**:  
   - At the **top of your code**, include a **link** to the problem statement as a **comment**.
   - This helps reviewers validate your solution and ensures the contribution adheres to the problem's context.
   - Example:  
     ```c++
     // Problem Link: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/score-more-buddy/problem
     ```

5. **Avoid Irrelevant Submissions**:  
   - Any irrelevant contributions will be marked as **spam** and **reported**.
   - Examples include multiple trivial changes, unrelated files, or repetitive solutions to simple problems.

## 🚀 How to Contribute for First-Time Contributors

If you’re new to GitHub and open-source contributions, follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Fork the Repository**:  
   - Click the `Fork` button at the top right of this repository.  
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**:  
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
     ```
   - Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username and `<repository-name>` with the name of this repository.


3. **Add Your Solution**:  
   - Create a new solution file following the **file naming convention** and include the **problem link** at the top as a comment.

4. **Commit Your Changes**:  
   - After adding the new file, commit your changes with a clear message:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added solution for <Question Name>"
     ```

5. **Push to Your Forked Repository**:  
   - Push your changes to your forked repository **on the main branch** (note: **we use the `main` branch, not `master`**):
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the `Compare & pull request` button.
   - Write a brief description of the problem and any other details relevant to the solution.
   - Click on `Create Pull Request`.

7. **Wait for Review**:  
   - One of the maintainers will review your PR.  
   - If any changes are requested, update your code and commit the changes.
   - **Note:** Keep an eye on the comments section of your PR for any feedback.
